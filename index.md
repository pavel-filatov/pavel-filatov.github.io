## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pavel

### I build and simplify data systems and improve Daily Work

A **Senior Data Engineer** now, I started my data career as a Data Analyst in 2017.  
In ancient times I studied geology and worked as a geologist.
And once created a geological startup.

There is this super simple and powerful idea from Charlie Munger (a little rephrased): 
> "Go to bed a little wiser than you woke up."

If I were to advise you the only thing, that would be it. 

I love finding such tiny bits of wisdom, and that was the reason to start writing on Substack.
In [flatMap](https://www.flatmap.blog/), I capture work-related stuff I wish I had known when just
started.
[Could Fill Books](https://couldfillbooks.substack.com/) is more general; there I gather the most important ideas
from the books I read.

Finally, in [/recommendations](/recommendations), I will keep all the books and such that I find great.
